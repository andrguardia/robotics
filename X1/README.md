This is experiment number 1. The focus of it is to learn how to set up the environment for a SOTA humanoid control model using lerobot entirely in a local simulation. 

**Why:** Build skill in deploying plug-and-play robot intelligence, prepping you to ship an instant-use SDK for any robot.

## **Skills Upgraded**

- Python environment setup and dependency management
- Running SOTA robotics frameworks and APIs
- Simulation toolkit use and interpretation
- Inspecting model outputs: actions, rewards, trajectory visualization
